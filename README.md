## LipReader – Real-Time Lip Movement to Text Translator

### Helping mute individuals communicate visually

---

### Overview

**LipReader** is a deep learning-powered application that captures lip movements through a live camera feed and converts them into text in real-time. Designed to assist individuals with speech impairments, the system leverages computer vision and custom-trained models to interpret visual speech patterns and generate accurate text-based outputs.

This project was developed by a team of four AI-ML students and aims to promote inclusive, assistive communication technologies.

---

### Key Features

* **Real-Time Lip Recognition**
  Uses OpenCV to capture and process live video for detecting lip movements.

* **Custom CNN-LSTM Model**
  A deep learning model trained on curated lip-reading datasets for accurate predictions.

* **Text Output Interface**
  Displays recognized words in real-time as subtitles on screen.

* **Modular & Scalable Codebase**
  Organized into independent modules for camera input, model training, prediction, and utilities.

### Project Structure

#### `camera_stream.py`

Streams real-time video using OpenCV, detects facial landmarks, and extracts the mouth region for further processing.

#### `model_training.py`

Preprocesses image sequences and trains a CNN-LSTM model using TensorFlow and Keras. Supports augmentation and validation strategies for improved accuracy.

#### `predict_live.py`

Loads the trained model, takes real-time lip input, and displays predicted words on the screen.

#### `utils/`

Includes helper functions for image processing, facial landmark detection, and frame normalization.

---

### Model Architecture

The model is a hybrid CNN-LSTM Deep Neural Network tailored to visual speech recognition.
It includes the following key components:

* Convolutional layers to extract spatial lip features
* LSTM layers to capture temporal changes in lip movement
* Dropout layers to prevent overfitting
* Softmax output for multi-class word prediction
* Trained with categorical cross-entropy loss and Adam optimizer
